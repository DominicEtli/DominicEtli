- 👋 Hi, I’m @DominicEtli
- 👀 I’m interested in the intersection of healthcare and technology, specifically how data science and AI can revolutionize epidemiology and medical practices. My passion lies in developing tools and systems that enhance patient care, streamline clinical processes, and uphold the highest standards of informed consent and ethical practice.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about advanced machine learning techniques and their applications in predictive health analytics. I'm also exploring the ethical implications of AI in healthcare to ensure technology augments rather than undermines patient autonomy and care quality.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that aim to integrate AI into occupational health, create educational tools for healthcare professionals, or develop systems that support transparent and patient-centered care. I'm particularly keen on initiatives that challenge the status quo and introduce innovative solutions to longstanding healthcare challenges.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominicetli)) or drop me an email at [YourEmail](mailto:dominic.etli@gmail.com). I'm open to discussions, collaborations, or just a chat about the future of healthcare technology.
